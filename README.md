# The Lala List
A list of companies one would not want to touch with a 10ft pole while wearing a Hazmat suit. PRs for new additions are welcome. The list itself is in no particular order.

## Code of Conduct 
- In order to add a company, please Send a PR with company name and public proof of notoriety. 
- Personal grudges, word-of-mouth, arbitrary defamation, and second-hand knowledge would not be considered as enough proof. 
- Proof to be shared in form of screenshots, tweets, archive.is links - anything that is/was a public comment from the company management and is viewable publicly (without logging-in/paywalls). 
- Please do not send screenshots of private conversations and email chains of people simply disgruntled by work or interview processes.
